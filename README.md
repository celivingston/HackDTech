## HackDTech 2020 Team 8:
# text for local impact

Our idea was to create an SMS bot that can be used by smaller grassroots organiztions (such as nonprofits, relief funds, and mutual aid funds) to spread the word about their mission. Many smaller organizations do not have the ability to create websites that share their information and goals, and many of this size already collect donations on GoFundMe or Venmo. This SMS bot can be used as an assistant to very easily spread information about an organization, collect petition signatures, solicit donations, recruit volunteers, engage with social media and more.
